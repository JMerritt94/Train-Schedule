# Train-Schedule

>I used Google Firebase to make an app that shows a train schedule that updates in real time. Using Moment.js I was able to make an app so that you can see exactly when the theoretical train arrives.
 I also used Javascript and Jquery to allow users to add trains that then update the chart. I also had lots of fun with the CSS and used bootstrap to make it.
